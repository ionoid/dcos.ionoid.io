![Project Form](ProjectForm.png)

- Choose the board your are working on, for exemple **Raspberry Pi 3** by clicking on the board. You can mix different boards and architectures, but you have to make sure to not break your fleet by deploying apps built for other architectures. Otherwise you can lock your project to the selected archtiture, devices registered into the project must have same architecture, otherwise they will be blocked and will not show up in the project, unless you unlock the project architecture.

- Complete the form with the information related to your project.


Ionoid Supports multiple boards and device architectures. The following
table details supported boards:
