::: Requirements to build and extract docker images

1. Install docker and buildx for multi-architectures following this tutorial: 
[docker and buildx for multi-architecture
images](https://www.docker.com/blog/getting-started-with-docker-for-arm-on-linux/). This allows to build images for
different architectures.

2. Install [undocker](https://pypi.org/project/undocker/) which allows to extract docker image layers to a directory.
