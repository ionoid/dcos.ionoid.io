In this section you can configure how the device will behave on connectivity
failures, you have to set 3 parameters:

1.  The interval of time between two successive connectivity checks
2. The number of times the device checks the connectivity before triggering a
  network reconfiguration
3. The number of times the device will trigger a network reconfiguration before
  failing definitely and triggering a given action (like reboot or power off)

You have also to choose which action will be taken if the number of network
reconfigurations limit has been reached.
