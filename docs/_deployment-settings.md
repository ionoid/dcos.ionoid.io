### Deployment Settings

Here you can enable/disable two very interesting features that concern
deployment of applications:

- **The dual A/B application deployment**: if enabled, this will ensure that the
  application can recover even if the deployment is incomplete or corrupted
- **The application delta update**: if enabled, the deployment will only download
  the parts of code that changed in the application. Leading to a save of time
  and bandwidth which may be significant.
